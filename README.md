# SAR Ship Detection in Complex Scenarios: A Frequency-Spatial Dual-Domain Enhancement Framework


## 📖 Abstract
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection is a core task in maritime surveillance, but it remains highly challenging due to target scale variations, complex backgrounds, and heavy speckle noise. Existing methods often struggle to detect small vessels in noisy open-sea environments. To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end detection framework that integrates **three synergistic modules**:

1. **Frequency–Spatial Enhancement Module (FSEM):** Fuses Scharr-based spatial edge cues with frequency-domain contextual priors, significantly improving robustness against speckle and clutter.
2. **Multi-Stage Feature Enhancement (MSFE):** A lightweight Transformer-inspired block incorporating Polarized Linear Attention, DynamicTanh normalization, and Edge-Enhanced FFNs, enhancing global reasoning and stabilizing training.
3. **Small-Object Enhance Pyramid (SOEP):** Efficiently injects high-resolution details into deeper layers via SPDConv and OmniKernel without adding an extra detection head, improving small-vessel detection with minimal cost.

Extensive experiments on **SSDD**, **RSDD-SAR**, and **HRSID** datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves **state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency**, particularly for small-object detection in cluttered coastal and open-sea scenarios.
